  <p>Hi, we're Annie and Ashley, two juniors in Mr. Whitehouse's fourth period AP Computer Science Principles class.<br/> Here is a little bit about us.</p>

  <p>Annie: Three of my favorite things to do are read, write, and interact with dogs. In regards to the latter, 
I currently have a six-month old dog (husky-golden retriever mix) whom I get to clean up after every day. But it's worth it.
I write for CCA's Pulse magazine, play varsity tennis, have been a pianist for more than twelve years now, and have
 two younger siblings.</p>

  <p>Ashley: Three of my favorite things to do are play piano, spend time with my family and friends, and help the community 
by volunteering. I have a 12 year old brother whom I both love and hate. I am an editor in the Catalyst Science Magazine. 
I have been playing piano for 10 years now, and one of my favorite foods is pastaaaaaaaaaaaaa.</p>
